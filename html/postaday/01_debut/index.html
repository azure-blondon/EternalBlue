<h1>Debut</h1>
<p>This marks the beginning of a daily series where I try to improve at writing things.
So I will post something everyday (that's the point) and I have no idea when it'll stop.</p>
<p>maybe tomorrow,</p>
<p>maybe in a week,</p>
<p>maybe next year,</p>
<p>who knows?</p>
<p>There's a good chance I will talk about my studies (2nd year engineering), but don't worry (haha I saw you there), as I'll make it a challenge to make it 'not boring' to anyone. (everything is relative though)</p>
<p>Maybe i'll write small ideas I have, small poems, or just random thoughts. My goal is not to make good things (as <a href="../things/bad_things">I love making bad things</a>).</p>
<p>Anyway, I will call this series Postaday<br>
(it is very fun to say (try it!))
<br><br><br></p>
<p>See you tomorrow then!</p>
<p>have a nice day :)<br><br></p>
