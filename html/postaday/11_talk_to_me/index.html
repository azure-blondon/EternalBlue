<h1>talk to me</h1>
<p>look at me, straight in my eyes, and just talk to me</p>
<p>I know you want to, I know you really want to, and I do too</p>
<p>but you can't</p>
<p>at least you won't, for an obscure reason that you can overlook (and want to), but you don't</p>
<p>it's too difficult you think, but deep down you know you can, you are able to</p>
<p>with just a little push...</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>this teeny tiny push is too hard too, you mumble frustrated, looking at your recording of you saying it on your computer</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>that is enough</p>
<p>it's ok, take your time</p>
<p>maybe you'll retry when you won't expect it</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>¿who knows?</p>
<p><br><br><br></p>
<p>See you tomorrow!</p>
<p>have a nice day :)<br><br></p>
