<h1>I love to make bad things</h1>
<p>Embracing badness in all its glory</p>
<h2>¿What is 'good'?</h2>
<p>we could spend 10 thousand years defining what makes something good,</p>
<p>but right now I would like to write about making bad things.</p>
<h2>¿What is 'bad'?</h2>
<p>I don't mean something that is hurtful, just something of poor quality, something not really polished, maybe a bit ignorant, etc...</p>
<p>because the fun of spending 20 hours doing something stupid just for the sake of it gives soooo much more motivation than finishing with something good</p>
<p>and can be as rewarding.</p>
<p>last year I spent too much time implementing pokemon types inside my programming language (yes), each variable could have a type (fire, ghost...) and it would change their interactions based on if one was super effective against the other.</p>
<p>it was soo fun</p>
<p>also useless,</p>
<p>very stupid,</p>
<p>and time consuming,</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>but oh soo fun</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>10 days later I deleted all the code for these types to clean up the project.</p>
<p>I didn't regret any second spent.</p>
<p>having a stupid idea is silly enough, but actually implementing it is a blessing when you have the time:</p>
<p>it teaches you why your idea is stupid, but most importantly, you need to be resourceful to actually do it.</p>
<p>and the more bad things you do, the better you become at doing them.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>next time you have a weird idea, think about how fun it could be to do and if it's possible to do without consequences, give it a second thought :)</p>
